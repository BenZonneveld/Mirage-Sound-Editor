<p>The details of the Resample converter types are as follows:</p>

<table  cols=2 width=900>

<tr VALIGN="top">
<TD width=20%>Best Sinc Interpolator</TD>
<td width=80%>This is a bandlimited interpolator derived from the mathematical sinc<br />
function and this is the highest quality sinc based converter, providing a worst case<br />
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 97 decibels (dB) at a bandwidth of 97%.
</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN="top">
<TD width=20%>Medium Sinc Interpolator</TD>
<td width=80%>This is another bandlimited interpolator much like the previous one.<br />
It has an SNR of 97dB and a bandwidth of 90%.<br />
The speed of the conversion is much faster than the previous one.
</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN="top">
<TD width=20%>Fastest Sinc Interpolator</TD>
<td width=80%>This is the fastest bandlimited interpolator and<br />
has an SNR of 97dB and a bandwidth of 80%.
</td>
</TR>

<tr VALIGN="top">
<TD width=20%>ZOH Interpolator</TD>
<td width=80%>A Zero Order Hold converter (interpolated value is equal to the last value).<br />
The quality is poor but the conversion speed is blindlingly fast.
</td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN="top">
<TD width=20%>Linear Interpolator</TD>
<td width=80%>A linear converter.<br />
The quality is poor, but the conversion speed is blindingly fast.
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><br /></td><td></td></tr>

<tr VALIGN="top">
<TD width=20%>Target Pages</TD>
<td width=80%>Select how many pages the target sample should become</td>
